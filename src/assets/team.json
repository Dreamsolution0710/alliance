    "content": "I grew up an Army Brat and traveled all around the world. We were accustomed to moving every 2 years. I joined the Army and served in Korea and was called back to active duty for Operation Desert Storm. After graduating from the University of Louisville, I joined Unisource and then worked for many different stretch film manufacturers. I had the luxury of being trained by the best of the best and had many great mentors in my life. My most rewarding professional moment was starting Alliance Plastics with my Father who instilled in me the notion of duty, honor and integrity. My Dad served 4 tours in Vietnam and 30 years in the Army and my Mother survived war torn Korea nearly starving to death. I am truly grateful for the values that they gave me. At Alliance Plastics, we think differently, we want to make the greatest and most innovative products in what has become a stale and bland industry. We push the limits because we don’t know any other way. It permeates through our entire staff and what makes me so proud is their pride which is displayed from the products that come off the line to the highest measure we put on customer service.",
